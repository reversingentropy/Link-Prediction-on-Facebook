# Machine_Learning_With_Graphs

This repository includes two jupyter notebooks I have made while learning to use the package NetworkX and applying machine learning to a Graph.

1) I learnt networkx via https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7aVQ5FtEBU&list=PL2VXyKi-KpYsjoY2rx9NiWJyfmmD79H97 , a Python for Social Networks, produced by Dr. William Mattingly. The exercises are stored in learning_networkx.ipynb

2) I attempt to apply machine learning to a graph.
  The dataset is based on Facebook pages wherein : 
  G = (V,E)
  V = Facebook pages of chefs and restaurants.
  E = If they have liked each other.
The codes are stored in link_prediction.ipynb.
